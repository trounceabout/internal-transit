Cody: Welcome to Internal Transit, a podcast exploring ideas at the intersection of design, technology, and personal growth. I&apos;m your host, Cody, and today we&apos;re diving into a question that I think more designers need to grapple with: What does it mean to design with purpose?

Joining me are Sarah Chen, a design strategist focused on social impact, and Marcus Johnson, who leads design at a rapidly growing tech company. Welcome to both of you.

Sarah: Thanks for having us, Cody. Excited to be here.

Marcus: Great to be part of the conversation.

It&apos;s about understanding your users, their needs, and what impact your design is meant to have on their lives.
