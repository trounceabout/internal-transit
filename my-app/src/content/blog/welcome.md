# Welcome to Internal Transit

I'm excited to introduce **Internal Transit**, a personal knowledge management and discussion space dedicated to exploring thoughts, ideas, and creative work across design, technology, and personal growth.

## What is Internal Transit?

Think of this space as a subway system for ideas—different lines (blog posts, podcast episodes, portfolio projects) converge at stations of discovery. Each route is designed to help you explore different aspects of my thinking and work.

## What You'll Find Here

### Blog
Deep dives into design thinking, technology exploration, and personal observations. Articles covering everything from design systems and UX principles to reflections on learning and growth.

### Podcast
Conversations exploring big ideas, featuring guests and explorations of topics that matter. Episodes range from 20-45 minutes, perfect for commutes or deep thinking sessions.

### Portfolio
A curated collection of design and technology projects, with detailed case studies exploring the thinking, challenges, and outcomes behind the work.

## Why This Space?

In a world of fragmented social media and algorithmic feeds, I wanted to create a space that's:

- **Intentional**: Thoughtfully structured around my core interests
- **Long-form**: Room for nuance, complexity, and depth
- **Persistent**: A permanent home for ideas that matter
- **Connected**: A place where different formats (writing, audio, visual) support each other

## What's Coming

I'm in the early stages of building this out. Expect regular blog posts, periodic podcast episodes, and an expanding portfolio of work. This is a living document of my thinking and growth.

## Let's Stay Connected

Subscribe to the blog, podcast, or email newsletter to follow along. I'm building this space to share ideas and learn from thoughtful perspectives.

Welcome aboard. Let's explore together.
