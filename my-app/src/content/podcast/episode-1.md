  Cody: Welcome to Internal Transit, a podcast exploring ideas at the intersection of design, technology, and personal growth. I'm your host, Cody, and today we're diving into a question that I think more designers need to grapple with: What does it mean to design with purpose?

  Joining me are Sarah Chen, a design strategist focused on social impact, and Marcus Johnson, who leads design at a rapidly growing tech company. Welcome to both of you.

  Sarah: Thanks for having us, Cody. Excited to be here.

  Marcus: Great to be part of the conversation.
