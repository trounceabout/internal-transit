# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**internal-transit** is a personal knowledge management and discussion space repository for capturing thoughts, ideas, and explorations. The project is in its foundational stage and ready for implementation decisions.

## Getting Started

### Initial Setup
Before beginning development, establish:
1. Technology stack decision (Node.js, Python, etc.)
2. Primary use case (web app, documentation site, knowledge base, etc.)
3. Development environment requirements

### Project Structure (To Be Defined)
Once the tech stack is chosen, organize the codebase with:
- Clear separation of concerns (src/, tests/, docs/, etc.)
- Consistent module organization
- Documented entry points

## Development Workflow

### Common Commands (To Be Established)
Add these once the project is configured:
```bash
# Build
# Lint
# Test (including single test execution)
# Development server
# Type checking
```

Use `bun` instead of `npm` when possible for package management and script execution.

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **Status**: Not yet defined
- **Update this section** when the initial tech stack is established

### Code Organization
- **Status**: To be defined based on project type
- **Update this section** with architectural patterns and key decisions

## Testing Strategy

Define testing approach once project structure is established:
- Unit test framework
- Integration test approach
- Test running commands (full suite and individual tests)

## Linting & Code Quality

Define linting setup once dependencies are added:
- Linter(s) used
- Format checker
- Commands to run checks and fixes

## Important Notes for Future Instances

- Always verify larger changes before implementing them
- Break changes into small, incremental steps
- When this project matures, prioritize keeping this document updated with architectural patterns and common workflows
- Reference specific file locations using the `file_path:line_number` format when discussing code changes
